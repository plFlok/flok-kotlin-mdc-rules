# A set of rules for CursorIDE to align with my vision of clean code in Kotlin projects based on the Spring Framework.

The rules include:
- Splitting code into domain areas.
- Avoiding meaningless comments â€” code should be self-documenting.
- Keeping functions small, with names that clearly describe their purpose.
- Explicit bean configuration, avoiding the use of @Service and @Component.
- Maximizing application configurability through application.yaml.
- Not wasting tokens on spontaneous generation of large README files.
