# Mapper code
For mapping methods that transform one structure into another, create functions outside the class.

For remapping class A to class B, it is better to define an extension function:
fun A.toB(): B

You may define methods inside a class only if the mapper needs to capture some variables from the configuration.
For example, a mapper instance can hold a fallback logo path from application.yaml, injected via @Configuration.
