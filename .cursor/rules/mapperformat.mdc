# mapper code
For mapping methods transforming one structure to another create methods outside class.

For remapping class A to class B is better to create method
fun A.toB(): B

You can create methods inside class only if Mapper closures some variables from configuration.
For example: mapper instance can hold fallback logo path from application.yaml, injected from @Configuration
